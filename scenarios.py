            "The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall flickers with autumn stormlight, casting long shadows over the students. "
            "“The Triwizard Tournament returns,” Dumbledore announces, his voice calm but commanding. “Three schools. Three champions. Three perilous tasks. Each chosen by the Goblet of Fire to carry the honor of their people.” "
            "He gestures toward the ancient cup, its blue flames pulsing gently. "
            "“Tomorrow morning, the Goblet will be placed in the Entrance Hall. To enter, write your name on a slip of parchment and cast it into the fire. In three days, it will choose. Once your name emerges, there is no turning back.” "
            "With a final nod, he steps away. The candles reignite—but the Hall doesn't return to normal. "
            "Students lean in. Whispers spread. Friends begin to debate. Rivals lock eyes. Everything feels different. "

            "Hours ago, two students were found outside the second-floor girls’ bathroom—frozen in place, eyes wide, as if caught mid-scream. "
            "Behind them, scrawled in dark red letters: "
            "“The Chamber has breathed again. The Heir returns.” "
            "No one knows who wrote it. The professors haven’t said a word. But the whispers haven’t stopped. "
            "“Should we go see it?” someone finally asks. "
            "A few students stir. Some look excited. Some uneasy. Some pretend to be asleep. "
            "The fire crackles. The room waits. "
            "The Chamber is open. "

            "Now Peeves is shrieking through the halls: "
            "“Stay off the third floor! Or join the silent!” "
            "No one knows what he means. "
            "Tonight, the torches outside the Charms corridor burn low. The Bloody Baron stands there, unmoving. Watching. "
            "Back in the common room, tension simmers. Someone finally says, "
            "“Should we go see what’s going on?” "
            "Some glance up. Some pretend not to hear. Some already have their wands in hand. "
            "The third floor is waiting. "
            "So are the ghosts."
