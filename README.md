# StoryLine
StoryLine is a text-based interactive simulator and game where users guide generative agents through dynamic scenarios led by a generative game master. The story unfolds over a fixed number of rounds, with users making strategic decisions in response to plot twists. Some agents survive; others donâ€™t.
## How to Run
### Backend
1. Create a file called `settings.py` in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:  
   `OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"`  
2. Set up a virtual environment and install requirements:  
   `python -m venv venv`  
   `source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Configure your Google Cloud OAuth 2 credentials inside the virtual environment.  
4. Run the backend server:  
   `python app.py`
### Frontend
`cd sims`  
`npm install`  
`npm run dev`
